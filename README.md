# CoderGrayCat

## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/CoderGrayCat/CoderGrayCat.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- ONNX: `pip install onnx`
- ONNXRuntime: `pip install onnxruntime`
3. Set the necessary configurations in the script:
- If you want to use CUDA for inference (requires a compatible GPU), set the `cuda` flag to `True`.
- Set the `model_path` variable to the path of the YOLOv7 ONNX model file.
- Set the `input_image` variable to the path of the image you want to perform inference on.
- Specify the desired output layers in the `Layers` list.
4. Run the script to perform inference and save the output files.
