Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm CoderGrayCat! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm an AI enthusiast and passionate about exploring the field of artificial intelligence. This repository showcases my work and projects related to yoloV7.

Repository Overview
This repository contains various projects and code related to different aspects of artificial intelligence. Here's a brief overview of the contents:

extractLayerOutput.py: This script performs object detection using the YOLOv7 model. It loads the YOLOv7 model from an ONNX file and uses it to detect objects in an input image. The detected objects are saved as separate output files.
Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, please follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/CoderGrayCat/CoderGrayCat.git
Install the required dependencies:

OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
ONNX: pip install onnx
ONNXRuntime: pip install onnxruntime
Set the necessary configurations in the script:

If you want to use CUDA for inference (requires a compatible GPU), set the cuda flag to True.
Set the model_path variable to the path of the YOLOv7 ONNX model file.
Set the input_image variable to the path of the image you want to perform inference on.
Specify the desired output layers in the Layers list.
Run the script to perform inference and save the output files.
